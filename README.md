# myContacts---map()
I created reusable and customizable card components with React. This time I used the map() function.

This project is an application developed using React and basically allows users to view and edit personal contact information. 
Using React's powerful component-based structure, the project offers the ability to dynamically manage data along with a user-friendly interface.
**List of Contacts:** A list of contacts' names, phone numbers, and other basic information is displayed.
**Map() Function:** React's `map()` function is used to dynamically create and display the contact list.
